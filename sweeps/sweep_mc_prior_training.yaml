description: |
  Train Monte-Carlo BNN priors.
  Test different numbers of meta-tasks (i.p. also single-task setting).
  Test different training noise levels (during training we set a noise level different
  than the true noise sigma_n_true = 0.01).
  Test different numbers of samples used to compute marginal likelihoods during
  training and testing.
